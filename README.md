# Learning-Unity-ECS-2
_Continuation of the deprecated [Learning-Unity-ECS repository](https://github.com/starikcetin/Learning-Unity-ECS), updated for the new API._

This repository includes a bunch of small Unity projects in which I explore and learn Unity's new ECS and Job System.

  - [02.B - With GameObjectConversion](/02%20-%20Prefab%20to%20Entity/Assets/02.B%20-%20With%20GameObjectConversion)

  - [02.C - From the ECS](/02%20-%20Prefab%20to%20Entity/Assets/02.C%20-%20From%20the%20ECS)
