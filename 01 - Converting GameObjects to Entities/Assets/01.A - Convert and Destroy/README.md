# 01.A - Convert and Destroy #
Converts the Sphere GameObject on the hierarchy to an Entity using `ConvertAndDestroy` option of `ConvertToEntity` script.


## Notes ##

- This new conversion workflow greatly reduces the work needed to initialize Entities. I was upset for the removal of Injection-based API beforehand, but slowly I begin to like this new API as well.
