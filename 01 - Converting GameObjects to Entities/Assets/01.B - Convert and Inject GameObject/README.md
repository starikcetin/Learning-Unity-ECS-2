# 01.B - Convert and Inject GameObject #
Converts the Sphere GameObject on the hierarchy to an Entity using `ConvertAndInjectGameObject` option of `ConvertToEntity` script.


## Notes ##

- The GameObject remains in the scene, but I can't observe any difference with _project #01.A_ regarding the "injection". _(Perhaps I am doing something wrong?)_

- I can't find much information about this option. From the looks of it, it is designed to help people sync ECS world with their GameObjects. I believe this is meant as a continuation for the Hybrid ECS.

- Since I am more interested in Pure ECS, I won't be elaborating on this option too much unless I really need to.
